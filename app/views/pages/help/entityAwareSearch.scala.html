        We are currently testing support for <strong>entity-tagged
        text</strong> in Peripleo (text where references to places and people are tagged with
        <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.linkedDataView#linked-data">Linked
        Data identifiers</a>). Thanks to the
        <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.introduction#navigating-connections">
        networked nature of Peripleo's data model</a>, this allows us to introduce an exciting new
        feature: <strong>Entity-aware search</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> entity aware search is currently an experimentation stage.
        We are still working on a full implementation. Expect the occasional hickup - and bear
        with us!
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-is-entity-aware-search">What is Entity-Aware Search?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, literature search in Peripleo is <strong>fulltext-capable</strong>. That
        means that you can search inside the actual <strong>text content</strong> of the item, not
        just in the metadata (title, blurb etc.); and that the search results that are returned can
        include the <strong>text snippets</strong> where your search matched the content.
        So far for the conventional part.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to the entity tags, however, search results in Peripleo also reflect the
        <strong>places</strong> (and people) that occur <strong>in the vicinity of your
        search</strong>. Since you won't usually find this functionality in other applications,
        let's look at an example.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/fulltext/crocodiles.png")">

      <p>
        Try a search for
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#q=crocodiles">crocodiles</a>.
        We will also apply an
        <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.introduction#filter-by-type">item
        type filter</a>, so that we narrow down our results to <strong>objects</strong>
        <span class="symbol object">&#xf219;</span>. In our example, the search returns a
        single hit - &quot;The Histories&quot; by Herodotus. The map shows a number
        of dots and regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.introduction#navigating-connections">mentioned
        before</a> that because of Peripleo's networked data model, a single result does not necesarily
        correspond to a single place. A literary work like &quot;The Histories&quot; is a prime
        example, as it contains references to hundreds of places.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you see on the map, however, isn't all places mentioned in &quot;The Histories&quot;
        either. It's only a small part of them. Yes, you guessed it: it's those places that
        appear in the text in the vicinity of the term <strong>crocodiles</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="snippets">Text Snippets</h2>
      <p>
        Click on of the markers (or regions) on the map. The item details will show one or more
        text snippets, relevant to the combination of the term <strong>crocodiles</strong> and
        the place you selected.
      </p>

      <h3 id="source-links">Source Links</h3>
      <p>
        If supported by the datasource, the snippets will include
        links that lead back to the corresponding section in the source
        environment. In case of our example above, the source of the text is Pelagios Commons'
        annotation environment <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org" target="_blank">Recogito</a>
        which allows us to jump, for example, right into a
        <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/document/tjrrsqn4dwmgep/part/2/edit#72bbff3f-48f1-48eb-86d7-ec11ff2295e6" target="_blank">section
        where crocodiles are mentioned in the context of Ionia</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="metadata-search">Search by Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        Entity-aware search also covers the case where your match is based on item metadata
        rather than the content. Try a search for
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#q=herodotus">herodotus</a>.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/fulltext/herodotus.png")">

      <p>
        You will notice that the map is now much more densely populated. That's because your
        results include Herodotus' &quot;The Histories&quot; <strong>as a whole</strong>, with
        all the places it mentions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click a map marker. Again, Peripleo will show text snippets relevant to the selected place.
        Just without additional contextualization from a query term.

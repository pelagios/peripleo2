        We are currently testing support for <strong>entity-tagged
        text</strong> in Peripleo; that is, text where references to places and people are tagged with
        <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.linkedDataView#linked-data">Linked
        Data identifiers</a>. Thanks to the
        <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.introduction#navigating-connections">
        networked nature of Peripleo's data model</a>, this allows us to introduce an exciting new
        feature: <strong>entity-aware search</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> entity aware search is currently in an experimental stage.
        We are still working on a full implementation. Expect the occasional hickup - and bear
        with us!
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-is-entity-aware-search">What is Entity-Aware Search?</h2>
      <p>
        First off, search in Peripleo is <strong>fulltext-capable</strong>. That
        means if the item is a text (e.g. a work of literature), search will cover the
        <strong>text content</strong> as well, not just the metadata (title, blurb etc.).
        Search results that are returned based on a fulltext match will
        include <strong>preview text snippets</strong>. So far for the conventional part.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to the entity tags, search results in Peripleo also reflect the
        <strong>places</strong> (and people) that occur <strong>in the vicinity of your
        search</strong>. Since you won't usually find this functionality in other applications,
        let's look at a concrete example.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/fulltext/crocodiles.png")">

      <p>
        Try a search for
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#q=crocodiles" target="_blank">crocodiles</a>.
        We will also apply an
        <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.introduction#filter-by-type">item
        type filter</a>, so that we narrow down our results to <strong>objects</strong>
        <span class="symbol object">&#xf219;</span>. In our example, the search returns a
        single hit - &quot;The Histories&quot; by Herodotus. The map shows a number
        of dots and regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We <a href="@controllers.pages.help.routes.HelpController.introduction#navigating-connections">mentioned
        before</a> that a single result in the list does not necessarily mean a single
        dot on the map. A literary work like &quot;The Histories&quot; is a prime
        example, as it contains references to hundreds of places.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you see on the map, however, is not all of the places mentioned in &quot;The Histories&quot;
        either. It's only a small part of them. Yes, you guessed it: it's those places that
        appear in the vicinity of the term <strong>crocodiles</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="snippets">Text Snippets</h2>
      <p>
        Click one of the map markers (or regions). The item details box shows one or more
        text snippets, based on the combination of the term <strong>crocodiles</strong> and
        the <strong>place</strong> you selected.
      </p>

      <h3 id="source-links">Source Links</h3>
      <p>
        If technically supported by the datasource, the snippets include
        links that lead back directly to the corresponding section in the source
        environment. In case of our example above, the source of the text is Pelagios Commons'
        annotation environment <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org" target="_blank">Recogito</a>
        which allows us to jump, for example, right into a
        <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/document/tjrrsqn4dwmgep/part/2/edit#72bbff3f-48f1-48eb-86d7-ec11ff2295e6" target="_blank">section
        where crocodiles are mentioned in the context of Ionia</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="metadata-search">Search by Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        Entity-aware search also covers the case where your match is based on item metadata
        rather than the content. Try a search for
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#q=herodotus" target="_blank">herodotus</a>.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/fulltext/herodotus.png")">

      <p>
        The map is now much more densely populated. That's because your
        results include Herodotus' &quot;The Histories&quot; <strong>as a whole</strong> - with
        all the places it mentions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click a marker. Again, Peripleo will show the text snippets relevant to the selected place.
        However, this time without the additional contextualization from a query term.

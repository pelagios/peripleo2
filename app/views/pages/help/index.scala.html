        This quick tutorial will give you an overview of Peripleo's most important features.
        <strong>You will learn how to:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search for places, objects and other types of data</li>
        <li>Control the map</li>
        <li>Narrow down your search through filters</li>
        <li>See summary information about a specific dataset</li>
        <li>Follow up and filter by connections between items</li>
        <li>Use our (experimental) fulltext search feature</li>
        <li>Interpret Peripleo's Linked Data View</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is Peripleo?</h2>
      <p>
        Peripleo is a map-based search engine to data published and maintained by partners of
        <a href="http://commons.pelagios.org" target="_blank">Pelagios Commons</a>, a Digital
        Humanities initiative aiming to foster better linkages between online resources
        documenting the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data indexed in Peripleo is quite diverse. Right now, most of our partners publish
        information about ancient <strong>places</strong> and phyiscal <strong>objects</strong>
        connected to them, such as archaeological finds. But Pelagios Commons is growing, and we
        are beginning to include data about <strong>people</strong>, <strong>time periods</strong>,
        and even fulltexts of geo-tagged literature, or transcribed scans of historic maps.
        The full list of datasets currently indexed is
        <a href="@controllers.pages.about.routes.AboutController.index">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Searching</h2>
      <p>
        Use the <strong>search box</strong> in the upper left corner to search by keyword. Peripleo
        will provide suggestions for search terms and specific records matching your query.
        Run the query by hitting enter or selecting a query suggestion; or pick one of the suggested
        results directly, by selecting it from the list.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/autocomplete.png")">

      <h3>Search syntax</h3>
      <p>
        Peripleo supports <strong>prefix</strong> as well as <strong>fuzzy</strong> search: append
        <span class="char">*</span> to find everything that starts with the given search term; or
        append <span class="char">~</span> to include approximate matches (i.e. those that differ
        by a few characters).
      </p>

      <p>Use <strong>AND</strong> or <strong>OR</strong> uppercase
        keywords to construct boolean queries, or quote your search with
        <span class="char">&quot;</span> to force exact phrase matches.
      </p>

      <h3>Colour coding</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the interface, search results are coded based on their item type, using colour
        and symbol:
      </p>
      <ul class="symbology">
        <li><span class="icon place">&#xf041;</span> Places</li>
        <li><span class="icon object">&#xf219;</span> Objects</li>
        <li><span class="icon period">&#xf017;</span> Time periods</li>
        <li><span class="icon person">&#xf007;</span> People</li>
        <li><span class="icon dataset">&#xf187;</span> Records that describe a complete dataset</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Controlling the Map</h2>
      <p>
        Move the map by dragging and releasing it. Zoom using your mousewheel or the
        <span class="char">+</span> <span class="char">-</span> buttons in the upper
        right corner. On touch devices you can also use a &quot;pinch&quot; gesture.
        You can switch between different base layers using the
        <span class="char">&#xf0c9;</span> button.
      </p>

      <h2>Using the Filter Panel</h2>

      <p>
        After running a search, you can narrow down your results by using filters. Click
        the downward arrow at the bottom of the search box. This will
        unfold the <strong>filter panel</strong>. The most prominent element
        of the filter panel is the <strong>time histogram</strong>.
        It shows how your search results are distributed over time.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/filterpanel.gif")">

      <h3>To filter by time</h3>
      <p>
        Grab and drag the handles on the time histogram to define a temporal filter. A
        clock icon <span class="char icon">&#xf017;</span> in the search box indicates
        that a time filter is now set. (It's easy to forget once you have closed the
        filter panel again!)
      </p>

      <h3>To filter by data source</h3>
      <p>
        Click the <strong>sources</strong> facet. Pick one of the data sources from the list
        in order to restrict your search to this dataset only.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> we will be introducing additional facet filters over time, which
        will work exactly the same way. For the time being, however, the data source facet is
        the only one that's functional. Bear with us!
      </p>

      <h3>To filter by item type</h3>
      <p>
        Click the coloured bar above the time histogram. This bar illustrates how your results are
        distributed across different <strong>item types</strong>. Often, the bar will have a
        single colour. That means that all of your results are of the same type. E.g. a search for
        <a href="#">tetradrachm</a> will likely return only object records; a search
        for <a href="">fortress</a> only returns places.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/typefilter.gif")">

      <p>
        Other searches will lead to a mix of places, people, objects, etc.
        Clicking the bar shifts the panel, which now shows detail numbers for how
        many of your search results fall into which item type category. Click one of them.
        This narrows down your search to the results of only this type. Again, an indicator
        in the search box appears in order to remind you of the active filter setting.
      </p>

      <h3>To filter by map viewport</h3>
      <p>
        <img class="float" src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/bboxfilter.png")">
        Click the filter icon located at the top right corner of the screen, right above
        the map zoom buttons. This will toggle the viewport filter. If active, your
        search is restricted to only those results that intersect the map area you are
        currently viewing.
      </p>

      <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
      <p>
        When selecting a dataset <span class="icon">&#xf187;</span> result, Peripleo will
        automatically switch into a filtered &quot;match-all&quot; search. That is, it returns all
        results contained within this dataset, while displaying dataset summary information in the
        selection box.

        This quick tutorial will give you an overview of Peripleo's most important features.
        <strong>You will learn how to:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Control the map</li>
        <li>Search for places, objects and other types of data</li>
        <li>Narrow down your search through filters</li>
        <li>See summary information about a specific dataset</li>
        <li>Navigate and search connected items</li>
        <li>Use our (experimental) fulltext search feature</li>
        <li>Interpret Peripleo's Linked Data View</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is Peripleo?</h2>
      <p>
        Peripleo is a map-based search engine to data published and maintained by partners of
        <a href="http://commons.pelagios.org" target="_blank">Pelagios Commons</a>, a Digital
        Humanities initiative aiming to foster better linkages between online resources
        documenting the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data indexed in Peripleo is quite diverse. Right now, most of our partners publish
        information about ancient <strong>places</strong> and phyiscal <strong>objects</strong>
        connected to them, such as archaeological finds. But Pelagios Commons is growing, and we
        are beginning to include data about <strong>people</strong>, <strong>time periods</strong>,
        and even fulltexts of geo-tagged literature, or transcribed scans of historic maps.
        The full list of datasets currently indexed is
        <a href="@controllers.pages.about.routes.AboutController.index">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Controlling the Map</h2>
      <p>
        Move the map by dragging and releasing it. Zoom using your mousewheel or the
        <span class="char">+</span> <span class="char">-</span> buttons in the upper
        right corner. On touch devices you can also use a &quot;pinch&quot; gesture.
        You can switch between different base layers using the
        <span class="char">&#xf0c9;</span> button.
      </p>

      <h2>Using Search</h2>
      <p>
        Use the <strong>search box</strong> in the upper left corner to search by keyword. Peripleo
        will provide suggestions for search terms and specific records matching your query.
        Run the query by hitting enter or selecting a query suggestion; or pick one of the suggested
        results directly, by selecting it from the list.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/autocomplete.png")">

      <h3>Search syntax</h3>
      <p>
        Peripleo supports <strong>prefix</strong> as well as <strong>fuzzy</strong> search: append
        <span class="char">*</span> to find everything that starts with the given search term; or
        append <span class="char">~</span> to include approximate matches (i.e. those that differ
        by a few characters).
      </p>

      <p>Use <strong>AND</strong> or <strong>OR</strong> uppercase
        keywords to construct boolean queries, or quote your search with
        <span class="char">&quot;</span> to force exact phrase matches.
      </p>

      <h3>Colour coding</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the interface, search results are coded based on their item type, using colour
        and symbol:
      </p>
      <ul class="symbology">
        <li><span class="icon place">&#xf041;</span> Places</li>
        <li><span class="icon object">&#xf219;</span> Objects</li>
        <li><span class="icon period">&#xf017;</span> Time periods</li>
        <li><span class="icon person">&#xf007;</span> People</li>
        <li><span class="icon dataset">&#xf187;</span> Records that describe a complete dataset</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Filter Panel</h2>
      <p>
        After running a search, you can narrow down your results by using filters. Click
        the downward arrow at the bottom of the search box. This will
        unfold the <strong>filter panel</strong>.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/filterpanel.gif")">

      <p>
        The most prominent element of the filter panel is the <strong>time histogram</strong>.
        It shows how your search results are distributed over time.
      </p>

      <h3>To filter by time</h3>
      <p>
        Grab and drag the handles on the time histogram to define a temporal filter. A
        clock icon <span class="char icon">&#xf017;</span> in the search box indicates
        that a time filter is now set. (It's easy to forget once you have closed the
        filter panel again!)
      </p>

      <h3>To filter by data source</h3>
      <p>
        Click the <strong>sources</strong> facet. Pick one of the data sources from the list
        in order to restrict your search to this dataset only.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> we will be introducing additional facet filters over time, which
        will work exactly the same way. For the time being, however, the data source facet is
        the only one that's functional. Bear with us!
      </p>

      <h3>To filter by item type</h3>
      <p>
        Click the coloured bar above the time histogram. This bar illustrates how your results are
        distributed across different <strong>item types</strong>. Often, the bar will have a
        single colour. That means that all of your results are of the same type. E.g. a search for
        <a href="#">tetradrachm</a> will likely return only object records; a search
        for <a href="">fortress</a> only returns places.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/typefilter.gif")">

      <p>
        Other searches will lead to a mix of places, people, objects, etc.
        Clicking the bar shifts the panel, which now shows detail numbers for how
        many of your search results fall into which item type category. Click one of them.
        This narrows down your search to the results of only this type. Again, an indicator
        in the search box appears in order to remind you of the active filter setting.
      </p>

      <h3>To filter by map viewport</h3>
      <p>
        <img class="float right" src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/bboxfilter.png")">
        Click the filter icon located at the top right corner of the screen, right above
        the map zoom buttons. This will toggle the viewport filter. If active, your
        search is restricted to only those results that intersect the map area you are
        currently viewing.
      </p>

      <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of through place or object, you can also start your Peripleo journey
        from a specific data source. Data sources appear in search results just
        like any other type of item. However, behavior is just slightly different when you
        select one.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/tutorial/dataset-overview.jpg")">

      <p>
        When you select a dataset (either from the result list, or from the list of autocomplete
        options) the selection box will show some general overview information: title, description,
        sub- or supersets this dataset might have, etc. At the same time, Peripleo
        automatically switches to a filtered search. That means it will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>list all results contained within this dataset</li>
        <li>show their geographical footprint on the map</li>
        <li>display their temporal profile in the time histogram</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As usual, the search box will show an indicator to remind you of the dataset filter.
        You can use all other available filter types to narrow down your search further, or
        enter a new query to find specific data inside this dataset.
      </p>

      <h2>Linked Data &amp; Navigating Connections</h2>
      <p>
        Underneath the hood, Peripleo is based on <a href="">Linked Data</a>,
        a way of connecting online resources that have some element in common.
        That common element could be <strong>Place</strong>, for example. Objects in
        Peripleo have an explicit connection if they are linked to the same
        place, through some relation. E.g. because the place is the object's findspot;
        or because the place is inscribed on the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single object can have connections to many places. Vice versa, each place will
        be connected to many objects. Furthermore, connections are not limited to just
        places and objects: as mentioned above, we are beginning to index data about
        people and time periods as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peripleo enables you to follow along these connection paths, and search within them.

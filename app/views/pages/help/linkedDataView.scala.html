        Data in Peripleo comes from many different sources. Very often, these sources publish
        information about the same real-world thing. A major historical place like
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#selected=http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F423025">Rome</a>
        for example, does, obviously, not just appear in one or two of our partners' datasets -
        it appears in many.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-is-linked-data">What is Linked Data</h2>
      <p>
        Luckily, our partners publish their data as <strong>Linked Data</strong>. Linked Data
        is a way of connecting online resources that have some element in common. It uses
        <strong>typed links</strong> (i.e. links with a meaning attached to them)
        to declare how different pieces of data relate to one another; or when they correspond
        to the same real-world thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peripleo uses these links to <strong>connect equivalent records</strong> from different
        sources. Therefore, when you select a place in Peripleo, the information that you see -
        image, names, description , dates - is usually not something published by a specific single
        authority. Instead, it is an <strong>aggregate of information</strong>, published
        collectively by partners of the Pelagios Commons community.

        Peripleo's info boxes provide, by intention, only a compact overview. Ready to
        dive deeper into the actual Linked Data that underpins them? Enter the <strong>Linked data
        View</strong>.

      <p>
        Let's start by selecting the place
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#selected=http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F344448">Lepcis
        Magna</a>. The row of coloured codes at the bottom of the info box are a hint to the Linked
        Data origins of the information you are looking at. Each code is the identifier for
        Lepcis Magna in one of Pelagios' partners' datasets. Let's take a closer look.
      </p>

      <img class="rounded" src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/ldview/ld-view.png")">

      <p>
        Click the <span class="char stroke7">&#xe616;</span> icon next
        to the row of coloured IDs. This opens the Linked Data View. The view consists of the
        <strong>link graph</strong> on the left side, and the <strong>record details</strong> on
        the right side.
      </p>

      <h2 id="link-graph">The Link Graph</h2>
      <p>
        The link graph shows how different partners' records for <strong>Lepcis Magna</strong>
        connect to each other. For example the
        <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21127" target="_blank">record in the Digital Atlas of
        the Roman Empire</a>
        <span class="item-identifier dare"><a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21127" target="_blank">dare:21127</a></span>
        links to its
        <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/344448" target="_blank">counterpart in the Pleiades
        Gazetteer of the Ancient World</a>
        <span class="item-identifier pleiades"><a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/344448" target="_blank">pleiades:344448</a></span>;
        Archaeological Atlas of Antiquity
        <a href="http://vici.org/vici/2448" target="_blank">Vici.org</a>
        <span class="item-identifier vici"><a href="http://vici.org/vici/2448" target="_blank">vici:2448</a></span>
        links to to Pleiades as well as
        to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q191504" target="_blank">the equivalent Wikidata
        record</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Exact vs. Close Match</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of indicating equivalence, Pelagios partners use two different types of links.
        (The types are defined through a Linked Data vocabulary called the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System">Simple
        Knowledge Organization System</a> SKOS.) One of the types indicates an <strong>exact
        match</strong> (solid line), meaning the record is conceptually identical - it represents
        the same place in terms of geographical, cultural and temporal scope. The other link
        indicates a <strong>close match</strong> (dashed line), which means the records are pretty
        close, but do not necessarily the exact same thing. Our partners use this type, among other
        things, to connect an ancient place in their dataset to its modern successor in another.
      </p>

      <h3>Indexed vs. External Records</h3>
      <p>
        Coloured dots in the graph represent records that Peripleo has indexed.
        White dots, on the other hand, are links to <strong>external datasets</strong>. Partners
        link to them in their records, but Peripleo does currently not harvest any further
        information from them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="record-details">Record Details</h2>
      <!-- p>
        For records that include coordinates, the map shows colour coded markers. Different
        sources will have varying data about location - as well as other aspects. They may
        sometimes even contradict each other. For the sake of keeping interaction, Peripleo's
        main interface conceals much of this variation. Therefore be sure to always dig down
        into the Linked Data view, in order

           - and in Linked Data, that's perfectly ok.

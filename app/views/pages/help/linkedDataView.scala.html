        Data in Peripleo comes from many sources. Our sources often publish
        information about the same real-world thing. A major historical place like
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#selected=http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F423025">Rome</a>
        for example, does not just appear in one or two of our partners' datasets -
        it appears in many.
      </p>

      <h2 id="linked-data">Linked Data</h2>
      <p>
        Luckily, our partners publish their data as <strong>Linked Data</strong>. Linked Data
        is a way of connecting online resources that have some element in common. It uses
        <strong>typed links</strong> (i.e. links with a meaning attached to them)
        to declare how different pieces of data relate to one another; or when they are
        about the same real-world thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peripleo uses these links to <strong>connect equivalent records</strong>. Therefore, when 
        you select a place in Peripleo, the information that you see - image, names, description, 
        dates - is usually not from one specific authority. Instead, it is an <strong>aggregate of 
        information</strong>, published collectively by members of the Pelagios Commons community.
      </p>

        Peripleo's info boxes, by design, provide only a compact overview. Ready to
        dive deeper into the actual Linked Data that underpins them? Let's take a closer look.
      </p>

      <h2 id="underneath-the-hood">Looking Underneath the Hood</h2>
      <p>
        Let's start by selecting the place
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#selected=http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F344448">Lepcis
        Magna</a>. The row of coloured codes you see at the bottom are a hint to the Linked Data
        nature of our information: each code is an <strong>identifier for Lepcis Magna
        in one of our partner datasets</strong>. What looks like a single entry for
        Lepcis Magna in Peripleo, is actually the <strong>combination</strong> of these individual
        partner records.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click the <span class="char stroke7">&#xe616;</span> icon next to the coloured identifiers.
        This opens the Linked Data View. It consists of the
        <strong>link graph</strong> (left)  and the <strong>record details</strong> (right).
      </p>

      <h2 id="link-graph">The Link Graph</h2>
      <p>
        The link graph shows how our individual records connect to each other. The
        <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21127" target="_blank">record in the Digital Atlas of

        to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q191504" target="_blank">the equivalent Wikidata
        record</a>, and so on.
      </p>

      <h3>Exact vs. Close Match</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of indicating equivalence, Pelagios partners use two different types of links.
        (The types are defined through a Linked Data vocabulary called the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System">Simple
        Knowledge Organization System</a> SKOS.) One of the types indicates an <strong>exact
        match</strong> (solid line), meaning the record is conceptually identical - it represents
        the same place in terms of geographical, cultural and temporal scope. The other link
        indicates a <strong>close match</strong> (dashed line), which means the records are pretty
        close, but not necessarily the exact same thing. Our partners use this type, among other
        things, to connect an ancient place in their dataset to its modern successor in another.
      </p>

      <h3>Indexed vs. External Records</h3>
      <p>
        Coloured dots in the graph represent records that Peripleo has indexed.
        White dots, on the other hand, are links to <strong>external datasets</strong>. Partners
        link to them in their records, but Peripleo does currently not harvest any further
        information from them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="record-details">Record Details</h2>
      <p>
        For records that include coordinates, the map shows colour coded markers. (Use the
        <span class="char icon">&#xf0c9;</span> button to switch base layers.) Underneath the map
        you can find the details for earch individual record, as they were originally provided by
        the partner.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will notice that locations, as well as other data will differ, depending which dataset
        they come from. The power of Linked Data lies in the fact that variety - and even
        contradiction - is perfectly fine &amp; possible. Peripleo's main interface needs
        to conceal much of this diversity for the sake of keeping interaction simple. Therefore,
        always be sure to dig down into the Linked Data view, as well as visit the original sources
        when exploring Pelagios Commons.

        Data in Peripleo comes from many sources. Our sources often publish
        information about the same real-world thing. A major historical place like
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#selected=http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F423025">Rome</a>,
        for example, does not just appear in one or two of our partners' datasets -
        it appears in many.
      </p>

      <h2 id="linked-data">Linked Data</h2>
      <p>
        Luckily, our partners publish their data as <strong>Linked Data</strong>. Linked Data
        is a way of connecting online resources that have some element in common. It uses
        <strong>typed links</strong> (i.e. links with a meaning attached to them)
        to declare how different pieces of data relate to one another; or when they are
        about the same real-world thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peripleo uses these links to <strong>connect equivalent records</strong>. Therefore, when
        you select a place in Peripleo, the information that you see - image, names, description,
        dates - is usually not from one specific authority. Instead, it is an <strong>aggregate of
        information</strong>, published collectively by members of the Pelagios Commons community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peripleo's info boxes, by design, provide only a compact overview. Ready to
        dive deeper into the actual Linked Data that underpins them? Let's take a closer look.
      </p>

      <h2 id="underneath-the-hood">Looking Underneath the Hood</h2>
      <p>
        Let's start by selecting the place
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#selected=http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F344448">Lepcis
        Magna</a>. The row of coloured codes you see at the bottom are a hint to the Linked Data
        nature of our information: each code is an <strong>identifier for Lepcis Magna
        in one of our partner datasets</strong>. What looks like a single entry for
        Lepcis Magna in Peripleo, is actually a <strong>combination</strong> of these individual
        partner records. Click the <span class="char stroke7">&#xe616;</span> icon next to the
        coloured identifiers to open the Linked Data View.
      </p>

      <h2 id="link-graph">The Link Graph</h2>
      <p>
        The link graph (left side) shows how our individual partner records connect to each other:
        <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21127" target="_blank">Lepcis Magna in the Digital Atlas of
        the Roman Empire</a>
        <span class="item-identifier dare"><a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21127" target="_blank">dare:21127</a></span>
        links to its
        <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/344448" target="_blank">counterpart in the Pleiades
        Gazetteer of the Ancient World</a>
        <span class="item-identifier pleiades"><a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/344448" target="_blank">pleiades:344448</a></span>;
        Archaeological Atlas of Antiquity
        <a href="http://vici.org/vici/2448" target="_blank">Vici.org</a>
        <span class="item-identifier vici"><a href="http://vici.org/vici/2448" target="_blank">vici:2448</a></span>
        links to to Pleiades, as well as
        to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q191504" target="_blank">the equivalent Wikidata
        record</a>, and so on.
      </p>

      <h3>Exact vs. Close Match</h3>
      <p>
        To indicate equivalence, we use two different types of links: <strong>exact
        matches</strong> and <strong>close matches</strong>. (Technically, these types are defined
        through a Linked Data vocabulary called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System">SKOS</a> -
        the Simple Knowledge Organization System.) An exact match (solid arrow) means that the records
        are conceptually identical. They represent the same thing in terms of geographical, cultural
        and temporal scope. A close match (dashed arrow) means that the records are pretty
        close, but not necessarily the exact same thing. Our partners use this link type (among other
        things) to connect an ancient place in their dataset to its modern successor in another.
      </p>

      <h3>Indexed vs. External Records</h3>
      <p>
        The cloured dots in the graph represent records that Peripleo has indexed, i.e. those that
        are contained in our partner datasets. White dots, on the other hand, are links to
        <strong>external sources</strong>. Our partners link to them in their records, but
        Peripleo does not currently harvest any further information from them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="record-details">Record Details</h2>
      <p>
        For records that include coordinates, the map (right) shows colour coded markers. (Use the
        <span class="char icon">&#xf0c9;</span> button to switch base layers.) Underneath the map
        you will find the details for each individual record, as they were originally included in
        the source dataset.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will notice that locations, as well as other data, will differ, depending which dataset
        they come from. The power of Linked Data lies in the fact that this variety (and sometimes
        even contradiction) is not only possible, but perfectly ok! Peripleo's main interface conceals
        much of this diversity for the sake of keeping the interaction simple. Therefore, be sure to
        always dig down into the Linked Data view - and follow up on the original sources -
        when exploring Pelagios Commons.

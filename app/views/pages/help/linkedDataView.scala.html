        Data in Peripleo comes from many different sources. Very often, these sources publish
        information about the same real-world thing. A major historical place like
        <a href="@controllers.routes.ApplicationController.ui()#selected=http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F423025">Rome</a>
        for example, does, obviously, not just appear in one or two of our partners' datasets -
        it appears in many.

      <h2>What is Linked Data</h2>
      <p>
        Luckily, our partners publish their data as <strong>Linked Data</strong>. Linked Data
        is a way of connecting online resources that have some element in common. It uses
        <strong>typed links</strong> (i.e. links with a meaning attached to them)
        to declare how different pieces of data relate to one another; or when they correspond
        to the same real-world thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peripleo uses these links to <strong>connect equivalent records</strong> from different
        sources. Therefore, when you select a place in Peripleo, the information that you see -
        image, names, description , dates - is not data published by some specific authoritative
        source. Instead, it is usually an <strong>aggregate of information</strong>, published by
        different partners of the Pelagios Commons community.
